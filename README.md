# Compose FTP

## Introduction

It is a **work in progress** ðŸš§. Any suggestions, feedbacks and contributions are welcome :

**Compose FTP** is a simply Android App built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It aims to
enhance the FTP experience on Android by offering users smooth operations, a pleasant interface
interaction, and secure file transfer services.

As the name suggests, it is based on **Jetpack Compose** and provides **FTP** services. It follows
the guideline of **Material 3** to a great extent, and also partly based on design pattern of MVI.

In short, if youâ€™re looking to use FTP on your Android device and getting trouble with the decent
interface with some elder FTP apps, give Compose FTP a try! :laughing:
