# Compose FTP

## Introduction

It is a **work in progress** 🚧. Any suggestions, feedbacks and contributions are welcome :

**Compose FTP** is a simply Android App built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It aims to
enhance the FTP experience on Android by offering users smooth operations, a pleasant interface
interaction, and secure file transfer services.

As the name suggests, it is based on **Jetpack Compose** and provides **FTP** services. It follows
the guideline of **Material 3** to a great extent, and also partly based on design pattern of MVI.

In short, if you’re looking to use FTP on your Android device and getting trouble with the decent
interface with some elder FTP apps, give Compose FTP a try! :laughing:
